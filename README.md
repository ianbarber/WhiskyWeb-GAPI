Some resources from my talk at Whisky Web in April 2013

jsbatch.html - retrieve the users profile and friends using a batch request
books-search.php - retrieve volumes from the Books API
plus-activities-search.php - retrieve posts from Google+
whiskies/ - very simple cloud endpoints API

All examples were correct at time of writing, but check the relevant sites for up to date information:
